# USNews-WebScraping
In this small project, I used the website of usnews to do an example of web scraping in Python, R and Java..

I decoded the html website code of usnews, then identified the second story of top stories. I web-scraped the title and the first three lines of body text of the second story by splitinig paragraphs into sentences using "tokenize".

At last, I wrote about:  
why I chose to go for the way I used.  
Why I used tokenize to split sentences rather than using "." .  
Why I further identified paragraphs rather than just go with the text of main_body.
